Requirements:
=============

  * GCC
  * GNU Make
  * pkg-config
  * Gtk3

Compilation:
============

A proper install script is still very much a TODO item.

To compile and run monitor you need to build it and then install its
GSettings schema.

To compile simply run the Makefile.

    $ make

To install the GSettings schema.

    $ sudo cp apps.monitor.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

and then call glib-compile-schemas to include apps.monitor.gschema.xml.

    $ sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

Then you can run the program.

    $ ./monitor [INTERFACE]

To get a list of valid network interfaces.

    $ ./monitor --list
